          <p class="major">
            
            Hi! I'm Brandy. Most days I can be found sipping on a strong latte & nimbling on a sweet pastry while learning my craft, software development. <span style="background-color: #E0FFFF">I am a software developer who codes with
            curiosity!</span>
            <br>
            <br>
            I began my career in STEM (neuroscience), veered off into the world of pastry and have come back full circle into STEM via technology. 
            After attending a vigorous full-stack web development bootcamp, I've continued learning through practice, participating in pair-programming, contributing to open source and more.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">My goal is to join a company that has a real heart for people.</span> 
            There, I hope to develop and inplement solutions to problems that add quality, ease, safety and beauty to user experiences. 

            <p class="major">A few other tidbits about me: rollerblading is my newish hobbie. 
            I have two sweet kitties. I design & market for my passion project, an online apparel biz. I also love travel and try to whenever I can. In fact, the picture of the beautiful dry landscape on this page
            was taken in South Africa! Thank you for popping by. You're certainly welcomed here!</p>
